PEP8 conventions to follow while coding in python:
--------------------------------------------------
1) Function names must use lowercase letters and words are seperated by underscores

	Example:
	--------
	def check_number(num):
		if num % 2 == 0:
			print('EVEN')
		else:
			print('ODD')


2) Leave 2 lines empty before and after function.
   (If the function is declared in the first line of file, then no need for leaving top 2 lines)

3) Leave space before and after an operator

4) Leave space after comma in all areas (list, tuple, dictionary, set etc)

5) Leave an empty line after the last line of code in a file.

6) Don't shadow the variable names frequently

	 Example:
	 --------
	 Using same variable name(which are defined global) as parameters in functions frequently.
	 Its a bad practice.

	 x = 5	# this is a global variable


	 def show_num(x):
	 	print(x)


	 x = 10
	 show_num(x)

	 Use different parameters instead:
	 --------------------------------
	 x = 5


	 def show_num(num):
	 	print(num)


	 x = 10
	 show_num(x)

7) Class name must follow "UpperCamelCase" pattern
	Example:

	class AnimalKingdom:

	class Car:


8) Method names in a class must follow lowercase and words are seperated by underscore

   class AnimalKingdom:

   		def makes_loud_sound(self):
   			print('....')


9) Don't use 'pass' in  a function. For testing purpose or for any other emergency like seeing the results instantly - use 'pass'.
   Otherwise don't use 'pass'.

10) Never use file names as pre-defined module names. Because it overrides.

    Example:
    --------
     Never name a file as 'random.py'.
     Because "random" is pre defined module in python.


11) Always follow proper indentation.

	 Examples:
	 ---------
	 1) Always allow one space to the left and right of an operator

	 	a+b  		(bad practice)

	 	a + b 	(good practice)

	 2) In any sequence of elements that are seperated by commas, use a blank space immediately after every comma.

	 	num_list = [1,2,3,4,5]			(Bad practice)

	 	num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]		(Good practice)

	 3) While using dictionaries,

	 	student_info = {'name' : 'Srinath',	'city' : 'hyderabad', 'age' : 30}		(Bad practice)

		student_info = {'name': 'Srinath', 'city': 'hyderabad', 'age': 30}			(Good practice)

	 4) In Function parameters, don't use space before or after operators whenever they are required.
	 	 But all parameters are seperated by comma and use a space after that.
		 No need to add space before and after equals to (=) in parameters

	 	(Bad practice)

	 	def calculate_sum(a = 10,b = 20,name = 'srinath'):
	 		print('Sum of numbers is : ')


	 	(Good practice)

	 	def calculate_sum(a=10, b=20, name='srinath'):
	 		print('Sum of numbers is : ')


12) Variables cannot be named same as keywords or in-built functions in python

		(Bad practice)

		id = 10
		int = 20
		str = 'srinath'
		list = [1, 2]
		sum = 100


		(Good practice) -> Variables should be descriptive for readability.

		id_ = 10
		num = 20
		string = 'srinath'
		num_list = [1, 2]
		sum_of_numbers = 100


13) Inline comment must maintain atleast two spaces after the statement.

		(Bad practice)
		x = 10 + 20# this returns sum of numbers

		(Good practice)
		x = 10 + 20		# this returns sum of numbers
