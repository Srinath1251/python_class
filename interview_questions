1) What is Python?
  - High level object oriented interpreted language.
  - powerful programming language
  - runs on different platforms like linux, unix, macintosh etc
  - objects, modules, exceptions, memory management

2) Advantages of Python?
  - Open source
  - Portable
  - its extensible
  - object oriented
  - built in data structure
  - simple and easy

3) What is PEP8?
  - its a coding convention about how to write code more readable

4) What are Python literals?
  - they are data saved in variables or constants
  - string literals, numeric literals, boolean literals, special literals, literal collection

5) What is a function?
  - its a block of code that is written once and used multiple time as and when required by a program.
  - built-in functions
  - user defined functions

6) What is web scrapping?
  - It is a method of extracting large amount of information available on websites into our local machines
    or onto database tables
  - pyquery, urllib2, scrappy, beautiful soap etc

7) File related libraries?

  - shutil (used to copy and delete files)

8) File processing modes in Python?
  - read only
  - write only
  - read and write

9) What is a module?
  - A python module is a .py file containing executable code

10) What is pass?
  - Pass means no operation statement
  - when a function has to be left blank , it is used

11) What is module and package?
  - Module : it is a python program file which imports other modules like objects and attributes
  - Package: it is a folder containing python modules.

12) Is indentation required in Python?
  - Necessary. Otherwise it will throw errors

13) What is Pickling and Unpickling in python?
  In Python, we have Pickle module.

  - Pickling: process of converting python object to string representation and dumps in to file using dump function.
    pickle.dump()

  - Unpickling: reverse of the above process is unpickling
    pickle.load()

14) What are the built in types available in Python?
  - Mutable: list, dictionaty, set
  - Immutable: tuple, strings, numbers

15) How can we consider variable and datatype in Python?
  In Python,
  - variable is an object
  - datatype is a class

16) What is the difference between list and tuple?
  - list is mutable and tuple is immutable
  - list has variable length and tuple has fixed length
  - iteration process in list takes more time than tuple
  - list takes more memory space than tuple
  - tuple can be hashable as in the case of making keys for dictionaries

17) What are Python Decorators?
  - Decorator is a specific change made to a python syntax for the easy installation
